p Hey,
p Just to let you know, #{firstName} #{lastName} (#{email}) would like to send you stories on Sunday. 
p To get started, copy and paste the italics below into your reply to this email.
p Then put in your own info instead of Barack’s, and write around five email addresses of people you’d like to send your stories to.
p We will send them an email saying that you want to send them stories, and explaining what Sunday is. It’s probably worth giving your people a heads up that you’re inviting them so they don’t think it’s just more spam.
p 
p First name: Barack
p Last name: Obama
p Emails I want to send stories to:
p michelle@obama.com
p tinyhandeddonald@trump.com
p angela.merkel@europe.de
p (Write as many as you like).
p Best,
p Louis
p Founder of Sunday
