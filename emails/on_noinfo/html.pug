div.d Hey,
+br
div.d Sorry, we looked in your email but couldn't find either your first name, last name, or emails you'd like to send Sunday stories to.
+br
div.d If something's wrong #{boundaries.on_noinfo} #{cmd.sundayHelp} to talk to a real person.
+br
div.d If you'd still like to sign up to Sunday to write stories, copy the below italics. Then reply to this email, paste in #{dummyname.firstName}'s info below, including his friends' emails, and change it to your own details.
+br
div.d We'll get in touch with every email address that you give us, inviting your friends to read your Sunday stories, and to write stories themselves.
+br
div.d If you only want to read people's stories (in other words, you don't have any friends' emails you want to send stories to) there's no need to sign up fully so you can ignore this email.
+br
div.d.i.u First name: 
div.d.i #{dummyname.firstName}
div.d.i.u Last name:
div.d.i #{dummyname.lastName}
+br
div.d.i.u Friends' emails:
div.d.i #{dummies[0]}
div.d.i #{dummies[1]}
div.d.i #{dummies[2]}
div.d.i #{dummies[3]}
+br
div.d Five to ten emails is a good amount (you can always add more later).
+br
div.d Yours,
div.d Sunday
