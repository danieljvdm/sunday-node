div.d Hey,
+br
div.d Sorry, we looked in your email but couldn't find your first name, last name, or emails you'd like to send Sunday stories to.
+br
div.d If something's wrong and you want help, reply to this email and write '#{cmd.sundayHelp}' to talk to a real person.
+br
div.d If you'd still like to sign up to Sunday to write stories, copy the below italics. Then reply to this email, paste in the italics and change them to your own details.
+br
div.d We'll get in touch with every email address that you give us, inviting your friends to read your Sunday stories, and to write stories themselves. We've put the email address for #{firstName} in there but you can take it out if you'd prefer.
