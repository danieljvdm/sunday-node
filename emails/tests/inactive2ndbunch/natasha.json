On the days that I don't press\r\nsnooze and curse my shortsighted alarm-setting behaviour of the night\r\nbefore, I drag myself out of bed, fasten my sneakers that I simultaneously\r\nlove and hate, walk to the gate trying not to wake the sleeping house of\r\nboth humans and dogs, and enter the cold, feeling somewhat astonished that\r\nI am actually doing this.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different routes I know, and I'll decide to run this one or\r\nthat depending on how I feel. They all begin in the particular Northern\r\nsuburb\r\nof Johannesburg now notoriously associated with state capture.\r\nWithin the first 10 minutes, I am almost guaranteed to run past a fellow\r\nrunner, or a flock of cyclists, or a group of ducklike walkers - quacking\r\nand flapping around their wings as they plod on. Probably all live in, or\r\nvery close to, the old suburb of Saxonwold, and most likely believe that a\r\nmorning exercise routine is key to a successful and happy day.\r\n\r\nAs I make my way under trees, and past strong walls with electric fences\r\ntowards Rosebank, I begin to encounter a wider diversity of passers-by. I\r\nsee couples of old women, laughing, carrying two or three heavy parcels\r\neach. I see groups of men walking fast in blue overalls. I see single men\r\nin brown overalls trying to keep track of the leashes of five or so dogs,\r\nholding on strongly but not quite assertively. None own dogs themselves, or\r\nhouses, or bicycles in Saxonwold.\r\n\r\nI always wonder what the men in overalls and the women with the heavy\r\nparcels think of me, trotting past them, saying 'Good Morning' and 'I'm\r\nsorry', having chosen to run in the wicked cold - partly because I really\r\ndo enjoy running, and partly because I really do enjoy the Berry Dairy\r\nsmoothies to which running entitles me (thanks, Discovery Vitality). I\r\nwonder what the men in overalls and the women with the heavy parcels think\r\nof the flocks of cyclists and the ducklike walkers. I wonder whether the\r\nflocks of cyclists, who I've heard barking with rage as they whiz past the\r\nGupta mansion, are as stirred by the Gupta's impact on the lives of the men\r\nin overalls walking behind them.\r\n\r\nThe men in overalls are most often young men. Perhaps if they had gone to\r\nuniversity, they would have graduated a year before me. I imagine what\r\nmusic they might like. Sometimes I think of asking them, but I never do. I\r\nimagine they are on their way to construct a building for someone who may\r\nas well be a cyclist, a walker, a runner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sat, 9 Jun 2018 at 12:11, Natasha Salant <natashasalant@gmail.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> The choice to get out of bed and go for a morning run in winter is\r\n> qualitatively different to the same in summer.\r\n>\r\n> On these dark mornings, my tired brain does something to accentuate the\r\n> softness of the duvet on the skin of my cheek, and I feel like I am\r\n> literally a different person to the one who set my alarm last night - a\r\n> masochist with the torturous intention of exposing my extremities to the\r\n> cold, not-really-even-daytime-yet air.
