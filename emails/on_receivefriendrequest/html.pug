  div Hey,

div #{firstName} #{lastName} (#{email}) would like to send you stories on Sunday.
div If that's OK, you don't need to do anything. They'll be added to your Sunday stories.

div If you'd rather not receive their stories, reply and write '#{cmd.removeWriter} #{email}'.

  div If you'd like to write Sunday stories, and not just read them, copy the below italics. Then reply to this email, paste in the italics and change them to your own details.
  +br
  div We'll get in touch with every email address that you give us, inviting your friends to read your Sunday stories, and to write stories themselves. We've put the email address for #{firstName} in there but you can take it out if you'd prefer.
