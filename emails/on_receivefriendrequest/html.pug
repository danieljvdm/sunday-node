  div.d Hey,
+br
div.d #{firstName} #{lastName} (#{email}) would like to send you stories on Sunday.
div.d If that's OK, you don't need to do anything. They'll be added to your Sunday stories.
+br
div.d If you'd rather not receive their stories, that's totally OK. Just reply and write '#{cmd.removeWriter} #{email}'. We'll explain to them that you prefer to keep Sunday just for a particular circle of family or close friends, no harm done.
