  div You might want to check that you're happy with who it's going to be sent to: #{readersHumanized}.
  +br            
  div (If only their email, and not their name, is showing, that means they haven't yet signed up to be a writer, so you won't receive their stories. Feel free to give them a nudge, if it won't be annoying.)

  div It looks like you currently have no readers of your Sunday stories.
+br
div You can easily add a new reader by replying with do 'ADDREADER newreader@theiremail.com' (which will send them an invite if they aren't yet on Sunday), or you can do 'REMOVEREADER newreader@theiremail.com'. And you can include these as much as you like.

div If your story doesn't look right, here are a few things you can do:
+br
div - write '#{cmd.storyEnd}' to mark where your story ends, if your signature is accidentally getting included
div - make sure you are sending an HTML email, not plain text
div - reply saying what the problem is and write '#{cmd.sundayHelp}' in your reply, which means a real person will investigate for you

div Yours,
div Sunday
