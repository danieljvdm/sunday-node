div.d.u Want to change your story? Or story text looking ugly?
+br
div.d You can always change your story by simply sending a new email to write@sundaystori.es. To give the story the best chance of looking good, make sure you are sending an HTML email, not plain text. STILL not looking good after that? See 'Still something wrong...' below.
+br
div.d.u Story going to the wrong people?
+br
div.d Add a new reader by replying with do 'ADDREADER newreader@theiremail.com' (which will send them an invite if they aren't yet on Sunday), or 'REMOVEREADER newreader@theiremail.com' to remove. Write as many commands like these in one email as you like.
+br
div.d.u Image missing, or want to change image?
+br
div.d Make sure your image is wider than 660 pixels (if it's not, we won't have included it). To change the image, reply with your full story again, attaching a new image.
+br
div.d.u Story includes unwanted text?
+br
div.d Write '#{cmd.storyEnd}' to mark where your story ends, if your signature is accidentally getting included.
+br
div.d.u Want to know which of your readers are signed up to send you stories?
+br
div.d If you can see your friends' full names in the list above, they've signed up to send stories. If not, you might want to nudge them to sign up fully.
+br
div.d.u Still something wrong?
+br
div.d Reply saying what the problem is, with '#{cmd.sundayHelp}' in your reply &mdash; that means it'll be forwarded to a real person who will investigate.
+br
div.d Yours,
div.d Sunday
