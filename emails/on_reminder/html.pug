div.d #{firstName}, #{boundaries.on_reminder}'d like to write a Sunday story this week, you should do it in the next 24 hours before stories go out.
+br
div.d (We've changed the time for Sunday stories to 7pm GMT to give you more time to write. That's 8pm British summer time, 9pm South Africa and most of Europe, noon PST, 3pm EST. And for the eagle-eyed among you, we've also changed our font.)
+br
div.d Two simple steps:
+br
div.d 1. Send your story to write@sundaystori.es in a fresh new email. All the text in the email will be taken as your story. If you'd like to include a picture, attach it or drop it in.
+br
div.d 2. Take a quick look at the story confirmation we'll send you to make sure you're happy with it.
+br
div.d Remember, you can write as little or as much as you want. If you're struggling for inspiration, you could choose a photo from this week and write about what it means to you.
+br
div.d Here are the people who'll get your story: #{readers}.
+br
div.d You can change those at any time by replying like this:
+br
div.d #{cmd.addReader} #{dummies[4]}
div.d #{cmd.removeReader} #{dummies[5]}
+br
div.d Also, we know emails can be a pain so if you'd rather not get these reminders, reply with #{cmd.stopReminders}.
+br
div.d One last thing: thank you very much for being a Sunday writer. I hope it adds something to your life and those of your readers. Sunday is early stage, and made by one person (me) &mdash; that makes you one of Sunday's very earliest users. I'd love to know what you think about it so far or if anything doesn't work for you.
