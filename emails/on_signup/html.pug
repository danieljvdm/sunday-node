div.d Hey,
+br
div.d Thanks for getting in touch.
+br
div.d Sunday is a weekly paper made up of stories written by the people you care most about.
+br 
div.d Each week, you get to write one story, which you can do at any time. On Sunday, you receive a single email with all of your friends' stories, as do they. And that's about it.

div.d.u How do I get started?
+br
div.d Copy Harry's info below, including his friends' emails. Then reply to this email, paste in the info and change it to your own details.
+br
div.d We'll get in touch with every email address that you give us, inviting your friends to read your Sunday stories, and to write stories themselves.

div.d One thing we want to mention up front: Sunday is free for now but will eventually cost Â£1 a month for signed up users. We've written a bit more about that at the bottom of this email.
+br
div.d We hope you enjoy writing and reading stories, and that Sunday adds something to your life!
+br
div.d Yours,
div.d Sunday
