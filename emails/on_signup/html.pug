p Hey,
p Thanks for getting in touch. Looks like you’re up for writing Sunday stories – great!
p To get started, copy and paste the italics below into your reply to this email.
p Then put in your own info instead of Barack’s, and write around five email addresses of people you’d like to send your stories to.
p We will send them an email saying that you want to send them stories, and explaining what Sunday is. It’s probably worth giving your people a heads up that you’re inviting them so they don’t think it’s just more spam.
p First name: Story
p Last name: Smith
p Emails I want to send stories to:
p bestfriend@wholivesabroad.fr
p mygrandma@aol.com
p family@family.com
p (Write as many as you like). WE RECOMMEND TO PUT PERHAPS 10 . not everyone will always want to write
p Best,
p Louis
p Founder of Sunday
